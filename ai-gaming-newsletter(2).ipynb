That's no small feat, considering just how good the first Hades was, but the sequel meets the 10/10 energy of the original game with an impressive amount of craftsmanship and fine-tuning. The end result is a game that not only builds on a strong foundation but adds to it with nuanced storytelling, captivating combat, and improvements across the board.\nRead ourHades 2 review.

Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nGuard Games delivered one of the best beat-'em-ups of the modern era with Streets of Rage 4, and for Absolum, it applies a roguelike spin to that genre. Fusing old school action with a world of swords and sorcery, Absolum's use of roguleike gameplay mechanics complement its rewarding and precise fisticuffs. The game is also a looker with its inspired art direction, and the constant sense of reward with each run makes it hard to put down.\nRead ourAbsolum review.

Arc Raiders nails that sentiment, as it combines moments of thrilling action with spontaneous cooperation that makes for an exciting journey directed by its very own community of players. Throw in satisfying gunplay, gratifying loot chases, and a cleverly designed endgame, and you've got a post-apocalyptic world to explore that's brimming with opportunity.\nRead ourArc Raiders review.

However, the company cannot disclose pricing due to various external factors. The Steam Machine aims to offer value comparable to that of a PC, but its price may be affected by factors such as tariffs and supply chain volatility. \nValve is taking a more traditional PC pricing approach, aiming for a good deal rather than selling the system at a loss and making up for it with game and accessory sales. The company's focus is on offering a unique product with features like quiet operation, HDMI, and wireless connectivity, rather than just the cost. \nThe Steam Machine's price is expected to be influenced by its small form factor, noise level, and integration of features like HDMI and CEC, which may justify a premium price. \nThe exact price of the Steam Machine has not been confirmed, but it is expected to be announced closer to its launch in 2026.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\n[9] Call Of Duty Hasn't Been Outsold By Another Shooter In The US Since 2006\nSummary: Battlefield 6 is reportedly outselling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US, with Battlefield 6 needing only 22 days to eclipse the lifetime sales of Battlefield 1 in the US.
